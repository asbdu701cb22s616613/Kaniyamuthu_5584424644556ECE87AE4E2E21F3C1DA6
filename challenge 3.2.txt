#3.2 implement a function called short_students that takesa list of ststudent objects as input and sorts the list based on their CGPA( Cumulative Grade Point Average) in descending order  Each student object has the following attributes:name (string),roll_number (string ), and cgpa(float ). Test the function with different input lists of students  
class student:
def_init_(self, name, roll_number, cgpa)
  self.name = name 
  self.roll_number = roll_number 
  self.cgpa = cgpa 
  def sort_students (student_list):
    self_student =sorted(student_list,key = lambda student:student.cgpa,reverse = True)
    return sorted_students 
# Example usage:
student1=student("Alice","S123",3.7)
student2=student("Bob","S124",3.9)  
student3=student ("Charlie","S125",3.5)
student4=student ("Devid","S126",3.8)
student=[student1,student2,student3,studen4]
sorted_students=sort_students (students)
# print the sorted list of students by CGPA in descending order 
for student in sorted_students:
   print (f"Name:{students.name},Roll Number:{student.roll_number},CGPA:{student.cgpa}")
